# Y2Q2 Project Innovation

Unity Version 2019.2.9f1

Needs android build support which is ~500MB

The settings are set to VR, which requires android SDK as it is built for Oculus Go

If you want to test it on windows/mac, you'll need to manually change the default player in the UI3DHandler, and the BalloonGame.
